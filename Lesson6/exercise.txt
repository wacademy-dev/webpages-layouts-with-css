<h3>Lesson 6 Exercise - Add a media query</h3>
<p>Open the Lesson 6 folder of the <code>web-pages-layouts-with-css</code> Exercises repo you cloned for this course and carry out the following tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make the browser window narrower to see how the content gets crushed as screen sizes get smaller. A media query will fix this!</li>
<li>Add a media query that applies to all media types below 768px (think in terms of devices that have a "maximum width of 768px").</li>
<li>In that media query, set the body element to have a&nbsp;<code>max-width</code>&nbsp;of 300px so the content doesn't get too crushed as screen sizes become narrower.</li>
<li>In that same media query, make all link elements:</li>
  <ul>
<li>have a width of 50%</li>
<li>have top/bottom margins of 30px and right/left margins of auto</li>
<li>display as block elements</li>
  </ul>
<li>Save the your work and open in a browser to see your changes. Make the window narrower so your media query can take effect, and you can see its results!</li>
</ul>
