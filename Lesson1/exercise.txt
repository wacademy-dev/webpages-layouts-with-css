<h3>Lesson 1 Exercise - Create a container element</h3>
<p>Open the Lesson 1 folder of the <code>web-pages-layouts-with-css</code> Exercises repo you cloned for this course and carry out the following tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the&nbsp;<code>index.html</code>&nbsp;file, add a div with a class of "container" that contains the paragraph (with an id of "one") and the unorderd list.</li>
<li>Save the your work and open in a browser to see your changes. You'll know you've succeeded when you see a thick black border appear around the paragraph and list!</li>
<li>(The black border is just a custom border I've set in&nbsp;<code>styles.css</code>. Borders don't automatically appear by default when you create divs; I've just written custom code for that to happen here. You'll learn how to set borders later in this course!)</li>
